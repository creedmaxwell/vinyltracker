## 🤖 AI Agent Overview

Spinfolio includes an AI agent designed to enhance how users search, explore, and understand their physical media collections.

The agent works by embedding collection records into a vector space, allowing it to reason semantically about albums, artists, genres, and other metadata rather than relying only on exact keyword matches. This enables more intelligent interactions such as similarity search, contextual recommendations, and flexible querying.

### How it works

 - Hybrid storage approach

    - A relational database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL) stores authoritative, structured data such as albums, artists, formats, and ownership details.

    - A vector store maintains embeddings of collection items for semantic retrieval.

 - Semantic retrieval

    - When a user queries their collection, the agent performs similarity search in the vector store to find contextually relevant items.

    - Results can then be filtered, ranked, or enriched using structured data from the relational database.

 - Incremental ingestion

    - New records can be embedded and added individually without rebuilding the entire vector space, allowing the system to scale efficiently as collections grow.

### Capabilities

 - Semantic search over user collections

 - Context-aware recommendations

 - Flexible querying across structured and unstructured metadata

 - Extensible foundation for future features (summaries, trends, insights)

This design allows Spinfolio to combine the reliability of traditional databases with the expressiveness of modern embedding-based AI systems, keeping the platform both practical and intelligent.
